# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard-in-Excel
1. Project Overview
The Coffee Sales Dashboard provides an analytical view of coffee sales trends over time, including revenue performance, customer behavior, and geographic insights. The dashboard helps in understanding key business drivers such as product preferences, sales by country, and the impact of customer loyalty programs. The goal is to identify areas for business improvement and optimize sales strategies for higher profitability.

2. Problem Statements
1. Inconsistent Sales Over Time
Sales figures fluctuate significantly, with peak months showing strong revenue, while other months have little to no sales.
There is a need to analyze the reasons behind these fluctuations and implement strategies for sales consistency.
2. Limited Geographic Reach
Sales are heavily concentrated in the United States ($248), with significantly lower sales in Ireland ($36).
The business needs to explore new international markets and increase brand awareness outside the US.
3. Customer Segmentation & Preferences
There is no clear insight into which roast type (Dark, Light, Medium) drives the most sales.
The impact of coffee size (0.2KG, 0.5KG, etc.) and loyalty card usage on sales needs to be better understood to optimize marketing efforts.
4. Underperformance of Certain Products & Customers
Some customer segments (e.g., Charlean Keave - $23) have significantly lower spending compared to others (e.g., Lem Pennacci - $53).
There is a need to implement targeted promotions, discounts, or personalized recommendations to boost spending among low-value customers.
3. Key Findings & Insights
1. Sales Performance Trends
Total sales show high variability, with peak months recording strong performance, while others show little to no activity.
Arabica and Excelsa varieties appear in different time periods, suggesting seasonal variations in coffee preferences.
2. Geographic Sales Distribution
United States contributes the majority of sales ($248), while Ireland lags behind at $36.
The business is highly dependent on the US market and needs expansion strategies for international growth.
3. Customer Spending & Preferences
Top customers: Lem Pennacci ($53), Carmelita Thowes ($48).
Lower spending customers: Charlean Keave ($23), suggesting potential churn or lower engagement.
Sales by coffee size and loyalty card usage need deeper analysis to determine their impact on repeat purchases.
4. Business Recommendations
1. Implement Consistent Marketing Strategies
Run seasonal promotions to maintain steady sales throughout the year.
Introduce loyalty programs or subscription models to encourage repeat purchases.
2. Expand Geographic Reach
Increase brand presence in Ireland and other potential markets through targeted digital marketing.
Offer localized promotions and partnerships with local coffee shops.
3. Improve Customer Engagement & Retention
Analyze customer purchase behavior to identify patterns in roast type preferences.
Personalize marketing campaigns by offering discounts on less popular coffee varieties.
4. Optimize Product Offerings & Pricing Strategy
Identify the best-performing coffee sizes and adjust inventory accordingly.
Test different pricing strategies for underperforming coffee types to attract more buyers.
5. Conclusion
The Coffee Sales Dashboard provides valuable insights into business performance, customer preferences, and geographic trends. By addressing inconsistencies in sales, expanding into new markets, and personalizing customer engagement strategies, the business can achieve higher revenue growth and improved customer loyalty.
